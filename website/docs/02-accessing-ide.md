# Accessing the IDE

As part of the lab environment, you have access to an AWS Cloud9 IDE.

To access the Cloud9 IDE, log into your [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and search for Cloud9 in the menu bar at the top of the screen:

![Search for the Cloud9 service](./assets/search.png)

When the main Cloud9 screen opens, expand the menu on the left side of the screen:

![Access Cloud9 service menu](./assets/menu.png)

There will be a Cloud9 environment named **eks-upgrades-workshop** available. Click the **Open** button to launch the IDE:

![Open the Cloud9 IDE](./assets/environment.png)

:::tip

If you do not see the eks-upgrades-workshop Cloud9 environment, this is because it is owned by another IAM user. Change the owner on Cloud9 Console.

:::

Once the IDE has loaded, we recommend you use the **+** button and select **New Terminal** to open a new full screen terminal window.

![Open new Cloud9 terminal](./assets/terminal-open.png)

This will open a new tab with a fresh terminal.

:::info
You might see the following message: `An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the UpdateEnvironment operation: User: arn:aws:sts::xxxxxxxxxx:assumed-role/eks-upgrades-admin/i-xxxxxxxxxxx is not authorized to perform: cloud9:UpdateEnvironment on resource: xxxxxxxx with an explicit deny in an identity-based policy`

This is because we are disabling AWS temporary credentials. You can ignore it and move on

You may also close the small terminal at the bottom if you wish.

Your IDE comes pre-configured to access the workshop EKS cluster and also provides a set of tools you will need, like the `aws` and `kubectl`, `pluto`, `eksctl`, `kubent` CLI tools.

```bash
kubectl version
pluto version
eksctl version
kubent version
aws --version
kubent --version
```

Along with the Cloud9 instance, this workshop already has provisioned for you all needed resources, including the Amazon EKS cluster. Check that by running the follow command.

```
kubectl get nodes
```

You should see the following output:

```output
NAME                                                 STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION

```

<!-- For example, run the following command to get details about your EKS cluster: -->


<!-- TBD: Provision cluster -->
<!-- ```bash
$ aws eks describe-cluster --name $EKS_CLUSTER_NAME
{
    "cluster": {
        "name": "eks-upgrades-workshop",
        "arn": "arn:aws:eks:us-west-2:1234567890:cluster/eks-upgrades-workshop",
        "createdAt": 1662084731.367,
        "endpoint": "https://7C18D86993E776387BB6C040FBA9D359.sk1.us-west-2.eks.amazonaws.com",
[...]
}
```

You can also check that you can connect to your EKS cluster like so:

```bash
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME                                         STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
ip-10-42-10-176.us-west-2.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   18h     v1.23.9-eks-ba74326
ip-10-42-10-56.us-west-2.compute.internal    Ready    <none>   18h     v1.23.9-eks-ba74326
ip-10-42-11-123.us-west-2.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   18h     v1.23.9-eks-ba74326
