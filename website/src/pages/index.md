# About the workshop

The Amazon EKS cluster upgrades workshop is built to provide you with a reference architecture that can help make your Amazon EKS Cluster upgrades **less painful and more seamless**. To achieve this, we have used a `GitOps` strategy with `Fluxv2` for components reconciliation (all add-ons and apps are managed by flux), `Karpenter` for Node Scaling along with `AWS Fargate` for hosting the addons, and `Argo Workflows` to validate what has to be changed before running the upgrade.
